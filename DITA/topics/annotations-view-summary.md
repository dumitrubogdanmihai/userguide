# Annotations View – Summary

The **Annotations View** in the SVN Client allows users to see not only what changes were made to a file, but also who made each change and in which revision. This view is accessed via the "Show Annotation" action, available from the History menu and several other views (Repositories, Working Copy, History, Directory Change Set).

When activated, a dialog box lets users configure options such as the revision range, file encoding, and how to handle MIME types, line endings, and whitespace changes. These options help tailor the annotation results to focus on meaningful changes.

Once configured, the Annotations View displays, typically on the right side of the application. It synchronizes with the History view and the editor panel, so selecting a line in any of these highlights the corresponding lines and revision information in the others. This makes it easy to track who last modified each line and in which revision.

The view is especially useful for understanding the history of changes in a file, identifying contributors, and focusing on significant modifications by ignoring trivial changes like whitespace or line endings.
